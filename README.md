# konverzija-valuta

This was my small learning project when I was starting with Android development. It was just downloading exchange list data and had a curency calculator.

Later it turned into a school project, where I added Artifitial neural networks to try and predict the exchange lists for the next month using Encog framework.

It's using the data from European Central Bank and World Bank for traning the model.

Code is pretty messy since I was in a hurry when writing it and didn't have as much experience :)

It was not written in MVP or simillar arhitecture, it doesn't use RxJava / Lambdas / Stream support or any ORM library which I would use if I was making it now :)
